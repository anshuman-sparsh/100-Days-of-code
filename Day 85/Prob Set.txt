âœ… Day 85 â€“ Async/Await & asyncio

ðŸ“Œ Topic: Advanced Python
ðŸ“š Subtopic: Async/Await with asyncio
ðŸŽ¯ Tasks:

1. Basic async function 
Write a simple async function say_hello() that prints "Hello, Async World!" after waiting 1 second using await asyncio.sleep().



2. Run multiple async tasks
Create two async functions, fetch_user() and fetch_orders(), each simulating work with asyncio.sleep(). Run them concurrently using asyncio.gather().



3. Sequential vs Concurrent Execution 
Write a script that fetches 3 "fake web pages" (fetch_page(url) with sleep).
First run them sequentially, then run them with asyncio.gather().
Compare and print the total time taken in both cases.



4. Producer-Consumer with asyncio.Queue 
Implement a small producer-consumer system:
 Producer puts numbers (1â€“5) into an asyncio.Queue.
 Consumer takes them and prints "Consumed: n".
Run both concurrently until all numbers are processed.
