🎯 Goal for Today:
Build a Micro-Blog where users can:
✍️ Write (Create) a blog post (title + content)
📄 Read all blog posts on the home page
No database yet — store posts in memory using a Python list (to simulate the flow).



📁 Project Structure:
micro_blog/
├── app.py
├── templates/
│   ├── index.html     ← Shows all posts
│   └── create.html    ← Form to submit a new post


📌 Features to Implement Today:
Homepage (/)
Display all blog posts
Loop over a list of posts using Jinja2 ({% for post in posts %})



Create Page (/create)
Form to submit new blog post: Title & Content
On form submit (POST), append the post to a list
Redirect back to home to view the new post



Post Structure
Use a dictionary for each post:
{"title": "First Post", "content": "Hello world!"}


Basic HTML Only
No CSS needed today
Use simple and semantic HTML with form elements



💡 Tips:
Store posts in a global posts = [] list in app.py
Use redirect() and url_for() after a successful post
Practice writing clean and minimal Jinja2 templates
