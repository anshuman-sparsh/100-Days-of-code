Subtopic: Habit Tracker: Full CRUD & Date-Based Logic

Today's Tasks:

1. Date-Specific Viewing:
Modify your main route to handle dates. It should look like /view/<date_string> (e.g., /view/2025-08-21). The function should:
Parse the date from the URL.
If no date is provided, default to the current date.
Fetch all habits and their completion status for that specific date.
Add & Remove Habits (CRUD):



2. Add: Create an HTML form on the page to add a new habit. This form should POST to a new /add_habit route, which saves the new habit to the database.
Remove: Next to each habit, add a "Delete" button that submits to a /delete_habit/<habit_id> route to remove the habit from the database.



3. Toggle Completion (Tick & Untick):
Upgrade your completion logic. Create a single route /toggle/<habit_id>/<date_string>. When called, this route should:
Check if a completion record exists for the habit on that date.
If it exists, delete it (Untick).
If it doesn't exist, create it (Tick).
Redirect back to the view for that specific date.



4. Date Navigation:
On your main view page, add "Previous Day" and "Next Day" links. These links should point to the correct /view/<date> URLs, allowing the user to easily navigate through time.
