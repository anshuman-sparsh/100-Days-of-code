âœ… Day 58 â€“ DSA in Python
ðŸ“š Topic: Python
ðŸ§  Subtopic: Medium-Level DSA Practice (Lists, Strings, Sets, Logic)



ðŸ”¹ Problem Set

1. Longest Consecutive Sequence
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2] â†’ Output: 4 (sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4)



2. Group Anagrams
Write a function that groups anagrams from a list of strings.
Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
Output: [["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]



3. Product of Array Except Self
Return an array such that each element at index i is the product of all numbers in the array except the one at i.
Input: [1,2,3,4] â†’ Output: [24,12,8,6]



4. Rotate Matrix by 90 Degrees (In-Place)
Given an n x n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.
Example:

Input:
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
]


Output:
[
  [7,4,1],
  [8,5,2],
  [9,6,3]
]
