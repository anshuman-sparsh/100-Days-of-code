AI vs. ML vs. DL: Understanding the Differences


Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Broad field: designing machines to perform tasks requiring human intelligence (e.g., decision-making, reasoning, perception). 


Machine Learning (ML)
A subset of AI where systems learn from data without explicit programming. Ideal for predictions or classifications based on historical data.


Deep Learning (DL)
A subset of ML that uses multi-layered neural networks, mimicking the human brain for complex learning tasks (e.g., image recognition, NLP,)requires large datasets and compute power.




Types of ML
There are three main types:

Supervised Learning: Learns from labeled data to predict outcomes (e.g., classifying emails as spam).

Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering customer groups).

Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error with rewards (e.g., training a robot to walk).






Typical ML Workflow
Data Collection

Data Processing & Cleaning

Model Selection (e.g., regression, classification)

Training – letting the model learn patterns

Evaluation – checking accuracy, performance

Prediction/Deployment – using model on new data





Tools/Libraries
NumPy, Pandas: Data manipulation & analysis

scikit-learn: Classic ML models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees)

Matplotlib: Data visualization

TensorFlow, PyTorch: For deeper learning and neural networks
