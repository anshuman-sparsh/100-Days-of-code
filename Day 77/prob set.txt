🚀 Day 77 – Flask + JavaScript Integration (Fun Mini Apps)
📌 Topic: Full Stack Web Development
📚 Subtopic: Flask with JavaScript (Frontend Interactivity)



🧪 Tasks for Day 77:
Mini App 1 – Simple Poll App 👍👎
Concept: A page showing a poll question with two vote buttons (e.g., “Cats” vs. “Dogs”).

Flow:
HTML shows buttons and current vote counts.
When a button is clicked, JS sends a POST request to a Flask route /vote with the selected option.
Flask updates the server-side vote count and returns the updated counts as JSON.
JS updates the counts in the UI instantly without reloading.




Mini App 2 – Color Palette Generator 🎨
Concept: A “Generate” button that creates a set of 5 complementary random colors with HEX codes.

Flow:
JS calls a Flask route /palette via fetch() when the button is clicked.
Flask generates 5 random HEX color codes and returns them in JSON.
JS dynamically creates styled <div> elements for each color and displays the HEX codes.
