Topic: Open Source & Python Skills
Subtopic: Finding Contributions & Practical Coding
Difficulty: Easy-Medium

Today's Tasks:
1. Open Source Exploration
Understand "Good First Issues":
Read up on the good first issue label. Project maintainers use this label to mark issues that are well-suited for newcomers.



2. Use GitHub's Search:
Go to GitHub and use the search bar to find issues with this label, specifically for Python projects.
label:"good first issue" state:open language:python


3. Read the Documentation:
Select 2-3 projects that seem interesting. Find and read their README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files to understand what the project is and how to contribute.



4. Analyze a Potential Issue:
From the projects you selected, pick one specific issue. Read its description and comments to see if it's a good fit for you.



5. Express Your Interest (No Coding!):
On the issue page you selected, write a short, polite comment expressing your interest in working on it and asking to be assigned.


6. Code Cleanup: Remove Trailing Whitespace
A common "good first issue" is helping to clean up a codebase. Your task is to write a Python script that reads a file, cleans it, and saves the result to a new file.
Requirements:
Read the content from an input.txt file.
For each line, remove any trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs at the end of the line).
Do not include any empty lines in the output.
Write the cleaned lines to a new output.txt file.

Example input.txt:
Hello World   
This is a test. 
Another line with trailing spaces.        
This line is clean.



Expected output.txt:
Hello World
This is a test.
Another line with trailing spaces.
This line is clean.
