ðŸš€ Project 1: Personal Expense Tracker
ðŸ”¹ Project Goal
Build a console-based expense tracker where users can add expenses, see their total, and check their balance.



ðŸ§  Concepts to Apply
def functions with parameters and return values
List to store multiple expenses
Basic menu logic using if-elif-else
Loop to keep the app running until the user exits
Optional: simple formatting, string concat, or data type conversions





ðŸ“Œ Requirements
Ask the user to enter their starting balance
Provide a menu with options:
Add expense
Show all expenses
Show total spent
Show remaining balance
Exit


Store each expense as a value in a list
Update total spent after each new expense
On exit, thank the user and show final summary





Youâ€™re free to be creative â€” add timestamps, categories, or even a basic password if you want, but the focus is logic, structure, and reusability.
