Build a console-based expense tracker where users can add expenses, see their total, and check their balance.

def functions with parameters and return values
List to store multiple expenses
Basic menu logic using if-elif-else

Optional: simple formatting, string concat, or data type conversions





ðŸ“Œ Requirements
Ask the user to enter their starting balance
Provide a menu with options:
Add expense
Show all expenses
Show total spent
Show remaining balance
Exit


Store each expense as a value in a list
Update total spent after each new expense
On exit, thank the user and show final summary
