Today's Tasks:
Here are 2 medium-level DSA questions. Focus on finding an efficient solution.

1. Group Anagrams
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order. An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example:

Input: strs = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]

Output: [["bat"], ["nat", "tan"], ["ate", "eat", "tea"]]

2. Container With Most Water
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the i-th line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Example:

Input: height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]

Output: 49
