ðŸš€ Day 76 â€“ Advanced Python: Context Managers
ðŸ“Œ Topic: Python
ðŸ“š Subtopic: Context Managers (with statement)




ðŸ§ª Problems for Day 76:
1. Log Writer Context Manager
Create a context manager (using with open()) that writes logs to a file log.txt.
Every time the block runs, it should:
   Append a timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
   Append the given log message(s)
   This way, any logging inside the with block is automatically time-stamped and saved.



2. Custom Context Manager (Class)
Build a context manager class Timer that prints how long a block of code takes to execute.



3. Custom Context Manager (contextlib)
Use @contextmanager from contextlib to create a context manager suppress_errors that suppresses any exceptions inside the block and prints "Error suppressed".



4. Database Connection Manager
Create a context manager for SQLite connections that automatically opens the connection and closes it after the block finishes, even if an error occurs.
