Topic: Major Project (CodeFolio)
Subtopic: Part 3 - Final CRUD, Polish, & Deployment


Today's Final Checklist:
Your application is already very powerful. This final checklist focuses on adding the last pieces of core functionality, polishing the user experience, and getting your project live on the internet.

1. Implement "Delete Project" Functionality:
On the dashboard.html template, make the "Delete" button for each project functional.
Create a route (e.g., /delete/<int:project_id>) that handles the POST request.
Security Check: Before deleting from the database, verify that the user_id in the session matches the project's owner.
Redirect back to the dashboard with a success flash message.




2. Implement "Update Project" Functionality:
Create an edit_project.html template with a form similar to your "add project" form.
Add an "Edit" button on the dashboard that links to an /edit/<int:project_id> route.
The route should handle GET requests by fetching the project's data and rendering the edit form pre-filled with that data.
The form should POST back to the same route to update the entry in the database (after another ownership check) and then redirect to the dashboard.



3. Create a Project README.md:
In your project's root directory, create a new README.md file.
Document your project. Include a title, a short description of what CodeFolio does, the tech stack you used (Flask, SQLAlchemy, etc.), and brief instructions on how to set it up and run it locally.




4. Final Polish & Error Handling:
Add styling to your new edit_project.html page to match the rest of the site.
Create a custom 404 error page. In app.py, define an error handler for 404 errors that renders a simple 404.html template to give your site a more professional feel.





5. Deploy the Live Application!
Prepare your project for deployment by creating a requirements.txt file.
Choose a platform (like Render, which you've used before) and deploy your CodeFolio project. This will involve setting up the start command (using Gunicorn) and configuring your SECRET_KEY as an environment variable.
This is the final step to showcase your major project to the world. Good luck!
