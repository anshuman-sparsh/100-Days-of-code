Subtopic: Semantic HTML + CSS Box Model
Todayâ€™s goal: Build 4 mini web layouts that help you practice using:
Semantic tags (<header>, <main>, <article>, <footer>, etc.)
CSS box model (margin, padding, border, width, height)
Layout styling (using classes and IDs properly)




1. Personal Info Card
A card that shows your name, short bio, and social links
Use <article>, <h1>, <p>, and <footer>



2. Simple Blog Layout
Header, a couple of blog posts, and footer
Use <header>, <section>, <article>, <footer>

Focus on padding/margin, image responsiveness




4. Newsletter Signup Page
