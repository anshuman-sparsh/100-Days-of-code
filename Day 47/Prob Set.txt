Day 47 â€“ Set & Tuple Logic Simplification (JS Version)
Date: 12 July 2025
Theme: Clean & simple problem-solving using Sets and simulated tuples (as 2-element arrays)



ðŸ”¹ Problem 1: Unique Numbers from Array
ðŸ“Œ Task:
Write a function that removes duplicate numbers from an array using a Set.

Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
âœ… Use: Set and spread operator



ðŸ”¹ Problem 2: Common Elements in Two Arrays
ðŸ“Œ Task:
Find all the common elements between two arrays using Sets.

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: [3, 4]
âœ… Use: Set and .filter()



ðŸ”¹ Problem 3: Count Unique Words in a Sentence
ðŸ“Œ Task:
Given a sentence, count how many unique words are present.

Input: "JavaScript is fun and JavaScript is powerful"
Output: 5
âœ… Use: .split(), Set



ðŸ”¹ Problem 4: Tuple Pair Sum
ðŸ“Œ Task:
Given a list of number pairs (tuples), return a new array with the sum of each pair.

Input: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
Output: [3, 7, 11]
âœ… Use: loops or .map() (simulate tuples with arrays)




ðŸ§° Tools Allowed
Tool / Concept	         Use Case
Set	                     Unique filtering, comparisons
.split()	             Sentence to word conversion
.map() / loops           Transform array contents
Array of arrays	         Simulate tuples (like [a, b])
