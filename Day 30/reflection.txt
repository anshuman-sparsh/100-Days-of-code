Day 30 â€“ Reflection Log âœ¨

Over the past 30 days, Iâ€™ve made incredible progress in my programming journey. 
I started with Python fundamentals and slowly advanced into building CLI tools, creating Flask web applications, and understanding how backend logic connects with the frontend.

What Iâ€™ve Learned:
- Clean Python coding practices
- Command-line tools with argparse
- Building web apps with Flask
- Using HTML forms and templates in Flask
- Understanding GET and POST requests
- Writing and reading files in Python
- Basics of GSoC and how to write a proposal

Challenges Faced:
- Initially struggled with URL routing and handling form data in Flask
- Understanding Jinja templating took some time
- Debugging form inputs and rendering responses correctly

What Iâ€™m Excited About Next:
- Learning to integrate APIs with my Flask apps
- Working with databases like SQLite and PostgreSQL
- Building a full-stack application from scratch
- Developing my skills for Open Source 

I feel more confident as a developer and am excited for whatâ€™s ahead. Letâ€™s go! ðŸš€
