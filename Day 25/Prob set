🔷 Day 25 – Project 4: Class-Based ATM System
🎯 Goal: Build a fully functional ATM simulator using OOP with classes and methods.




📘 Project Requirements
Create an ATM system with the following:

1️⃣ Account Class:
Attributes: name, balance, pin

Methods:
check_balance()
deposit(amount)
withdraw(amount)
change_pin(old_pin, new_pin)

2️⃣ Menu-driven Program:
Prompt user to log in with PIN

Show a menu:
1. Check Balance  
2. Deposit Money  
3. Withdraw Money  
4. Change PIN  
5. Exit  
Validate inputs (don’t crash if user types a string or wrong PIN)

Run in loop until user exits








🔧 What You’ll Practice Today:

Concept	                            Why It's Important

class Account:	                    Organize ATM functionality cleanly
__init__()	                        Set up user data
Class Attributes               	    Track balance, user info
Methods (deposit, withdraw, etc.)	Simulate ATM options
Input/Output handling	            Create a usable console app
