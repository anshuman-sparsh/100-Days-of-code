# 🚀 100 Days of Code – Python, DSA, Full Stack, and Open Source

Hi, I'm **Anshuman Sparsh** — a B.Sc. Computer Science & Data Analytics student at **IIT Patna**, on a mission to master software development from fundamentals to open source contributions.

This repository is my daily log for the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge — where I’m learning in public, building projects, and sharpening real-world problem-solving skills.

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ **Master Python Programming**  
  From syntax to file handling, OOP, CLI tools, and Flask
- ✅ **Solve DSA Problems**  
  Practicing on LeetCode and GFG
- ✅ **Build Real Projects**    
- ✅ **Learn Key Python Libraries**  
  `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `OS`, `JSON`, `Requests`, etc.
- ✅ **Explore Full Stack Web Development**  
  - **Frontend:** `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`  
  - **Backend:** `Flask`, `Django`, `FastAPI`
- ✅ **Understand & Use Databases**  
  `SQLite`, `MongoDB`, `PostgreSQL`
- ✅ **Work with Git & GitHub**  
  Daily commits, CLI projects, project versioning, PRs
- ✅ **Contribute to Open Source (GSoC Prep)**  
  Reading real proposals, beginner-friendly issues, roadmap building
- ✅ **Create a Public Learning Trail**  
  Documented via GitHub, Notion, X (Twitter), and LinkedIn

## 🧠 Milestone: Day 60 Completed!
- In the first 60 days, I’ve:
- Mastered core Python and intermediate DSA (Lists, Sets, Hashmaps, 2-pointers, Sliding Window)
- Built 15+ CLI tools, including a Currency Converter, Word Counter, and Regex Matcher
- Created 10+ web apps using Flask, with HTML templates and dynamic routing
- Designed responsive frontend projects using HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and Grid
- Deep-dived into JS DOM, built interactive UI apps like Quiz App, Expense Tracker, Tip Calculator
- Explored NumPy, iterators, generators, comprehensions, and decorators
- Practiced and pushed clean, modular code daily — with GitHub logs and posts
- Laid the groundwork for full stack and open source — ready for the next 30!

- Next Up:
- → Full stack mini projects
- → JS advanced (fetch, API calls)
- → Flask + DB integration
- → Open Source Prep
- → Polishing GitHub for real-world visibility
