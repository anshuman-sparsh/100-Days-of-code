# 🚀 100 Days of Code – Python, DSA, Full Stack, and Open Source

Hi, I'm **Anshuman Sparsh** — a BSc Computer Science & Data Analytics student at **IIT Patna**, learning in public and building real-world skills one day at a time.

This repository documents my journey through the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge where I’m consistently learning, solving problems, and building projects.
