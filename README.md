# 🚀 100 Days of Code – Python, DSA, Full Stack, and Open Source

Hi, I'm **Anshuman Sparsh** — a B.Sc. Computer Science & Data Analytics student at **IIT Patna**. I'm in the final stretch of a mission to master software development, from Python fundamentals to real-world open source contributions.

This repository is my daily log for the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge, where I’m learning in public, building and deploying projects, and sharpening skills for a career in software engineering.

## 🧠 Milestone: Day 95+ Reached!

Over 95 days, I've progressed from Python fundamentals to building, securing, and containerizing full-stack applications. The journey has been structured in distinct phases of growth:

-   **Phase 1: Python Foundations & DSA (Days 1-40)**
    -   Mastered Python from the ground up, including data structures, OOP, and file I/O.
    -   Built over **20+ Python CLI applications and games** like Hangman, a password manager, and a contact book.
    -   Solved numerous DSA problems, establishing a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures.
    -   Learned web scraping with **Requests** and **BeautifulSoup** to extract data from websites.

-   **Phase 2: Frontend & Interactive Web Apps (Days 41-75)**
    -   Developed a strong command of frontend technologies: **HTML, CSS (Flexbox, Grid), and JavaScript**.
    -   Built **10+ interactive frontend projects**, including a Quiz App, an Expense Tracker, and a Tip Calculator, focusing on dynamic UI with DOM manipulation.
    -   Integrated JavaScript with a **Flask** backend to create dynamic, full-stack web applications like a live polling app.

-   **Phase 3: Full-Stack, DevOps & Production Readiness (Days 76-95)**
    -   Deepened backend skills by building multiple applications with **Flask** and exploring **FastAPI**.
    -   Built a **database-driven Habit Tracker** with full CRUD functionality using Flask and SQLite.
    -   Integrated external APIs to create a **NASA "Astronomy Picture of the Day" Viewer**.
    -   Learned to secure applications by implementing **API key authentication**.
    -   Containerized a web application with **Docker**, writing a `Dockerfile` for portable deployment.
    -   Began the journey into **Open Source**, learning to find issues and understand contribution guidelines on GitHub.
