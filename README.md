# 🚀 100 Days of Code – Python, DSA, Full Stack, and Open Source

Hi, I'm **Anshuman Sparsh** — a B.Sc. Computer Science & Data Analytics student at **IIT Patna**, on a mission to master software development from fundamentals to open source contributions.

This repository is my daily log for the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge — where I’m learning in public, building projects, and sharpening real-world problem-solving skills.
